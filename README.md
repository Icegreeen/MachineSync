# üñç How to works

This SaaS project allows users to purchase and consume credits for various features. Administrators can control feature availability, assign credit requirements, and manage credit packages. Users receive free credits upon registration, and can buy more via Stripe. The system tracks feature usage and ensures features are blocked if insufficient credits are available.
